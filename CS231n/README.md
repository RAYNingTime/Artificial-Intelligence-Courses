# CS231n - Winter 2016

This repository contains code examples and assignments from the CS231n course, "Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition" offered in Winter 2016. The course materials were originally presented on YouTube.

**Note:** Some of the code examples in this repository may be direct rewrites of the code demonstrated in the course videos.

## Course Information

**Course Title:** CS231n - Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition  
**Course Description:** Computer Vision has become ubiquitous in our society, with applications in search, image understanding, apps, mapping, medicine, drones, and self-driving cars. Core to many of these applications are visual recognition tasks such as image classification, localization, and detection. This course provides a deep dive into the details of deep learning architectures, with a specific focus on learning end-to-end models for visual recognition tasks, particularly image classification. Over the 10-week duration of the course, students learn to implement, train, and debug their own neural networks, gaining a detailed understanding of cutting-edge research in computer vision. The final assignment involves training a multi-million parameter convolutional neural network and applying it to the largest image classification dataset, ImageNet. The course covers the setup of image recognition problems, learning algorithms (e.g., backpropagation), practical engineering tricks for training and fine-tuning networks, and guides students through hands-on assignments and a final course project. Much of the background and materials for this course are drawn from the ImageNet Challenge.
