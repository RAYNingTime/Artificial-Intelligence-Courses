This file provides information regarding a tutorial on building a neural network using PyTorch. Here is a summary of the sections covered:

1. **Introduction and Setup**: The notebook begins with some initial setup, including importing necessary libraries and setting up the environment.

2. **Get Device for Training**: This section checks the availability of hardware accelerators like GPU or MPS and selects the appropriate device for training the model.

3. **Define the Class**: The notebook defines a custom neural network class by subclassing `nn.Module` and implementing the necessary methods for initialization and forward pass.

4. **Create an Instance of the Model**: An instance of the neural network model is created and moved to the selected device. The structure of the model is printed.

5. **Model Evaluation**: The model is evaluated by passing a sample input through it. The predicted class is obtained using the softmax function.

6. **Model Layers**: This section breaks down the layers in the FashionMNIST model and demonstrates their functionality. It includes explanations and examples of `nn.Flatten`, `nn.Linear`, `nn.ReLU`, and `nn.Sequential` layers.

7. **Model Parameters**: The concept of model parameters is introduced, which are the weights and biases associated with the layers. The notebook demonstrates how to access and manipulate these parameters.

The notebook provides a step-by-step guide for building a neural network model using PyTorch and understanding the different components involved.
